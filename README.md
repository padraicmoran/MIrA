Manuscripts with Irish Associations  
http://www.mira.ie

A project by PÃ¡draic Moran, Classics, University of Galway (Ireland).  
http://www.pmoran.ie

The project contains two elements:

1) A catalogue of manuscripts relevant to the study of early Irish book culture (before AD 1000.)
The core of the catalogue is c. 160 manuscripts probably written in Ireland and/or in Irish script (often written on the Continent).
In addition, there are manuscripts written by named Irish scribes (not always in Irish script), thought to be from Irish exemplars, containing Irish texts, etc.

2) A web-based digital resource for viewing and exploring manuscripts. This is written in PHP and based on data supplied in XML files. 
The resource is intended to be lightweight and easy to adapt to other projects.
